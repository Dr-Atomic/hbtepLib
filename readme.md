# HBTEP

This is my personal code for data analysis on [HBTEP](http://sites.apam.columbia.edu/HBT-EP/) at [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu/).  

For now, the intent of this project is for my personal use, but longterm, I wish to be able to pass on a functional code base to future students working on HBTEP. 

You can contact me, John Brooks, at <jwb2159@columbia.edu> with any questions.  

## Getting started with git

I recommend the following youtube video:

## Notes

You need to create a preferences.py file in the hbtep directory if you want to use this code.  This file should contain the variable:

_HBT_SERVER_ADDRESS = 'str'

which points at our data server.  Because I don't wish for this address to be public knowledge, you will need to get this address from me.  This is also why preferences.py is an ignored file with the project.
