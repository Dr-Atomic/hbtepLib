# HBTEP

This is my personal code for data analysis on [HBTEP](http://sites.apam.columbia.edu/HBT-EP/) at [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu/).  

For now, the intent of this project is for my personal use, but longterm, I wish to be able to pass on a functional code base to future students working on HBTEP. 

You can contact me, John Brooks, at <jwb2159@columbia.edu> with any questions.  

## Getting started with git

I recommend the following youtube video:
[Git Tutorial for Beginners: Command-Line Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVsySz-h9r4)

## Installation for command line

1. Make sure git is installed on your computer.  You can check by running '$ git --version'
2. Clone the repository.  Navigate to a directory in which you want to place the library.  Then type '$ git clone https://github.com/jwbrooks0/hbtepLib'  . An hbtepLib folder should now exist there.
3. Add this new directory to PYTHON_PATH.  You can check your PYTHON_PATH env. variable with the command '$ echo $PYTHON_PATH'.  If the directory in which you placed hbtepLib is not there, you'll need to add it.  Open ~/.profile and add the address to the hbtep folder.


## Notes

You need to create a preferences.py file in the hbtep directory if you want to use this code.  This file should contain the variable:

_HBT_SERVER_ADDRESS = 'str'

which points at our data server.  Because I don't wish for this address to be public knowledge, you will need to get this address from me.  This is also why preferences.py is an ignored file with the project.
